INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer



If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.1.1"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev the0rist/yii2-basic-plus basic-plus
~~~
OR (if your Composer is installed globally)
~~~
composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.1.1"
composer create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev the0rist/yii2-basic-plus basic-plus
~~~

ACCESS TO YOUR APPLICATION
--------------------------
#### Local web-server

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic-plus` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic-plus/web/
~~~

#### Vagrant
 
Run `sudo vagrant up` from your terminal (in the project root), drink some coffee while VM is preparing, then add this line to your hosts file: 
~~~
192.168.56.102 yii2basic.dev
~~~
Now you can access your project inside Virtual Box VM.
> **Note:**
> - This method requires pre-installed [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) on your machine.
> - You can configure 'mariadb' or 'mysql' section in your `puphpet/config.yml` if you need custom settings.

FIRST RUN
---------

Don't forget to do `php init` in your terminal inside the project root directory and select your environment.

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it (only for local web-servers, Vagrant will create it automatically).
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.
